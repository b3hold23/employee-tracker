This application is used to track an employee by their role, department, or name. You can put in the salary of the role as well. This application can then display the information in tables for you by Employee, Department, or Role. You can add and delete employees, departments, and roles.

## Installation
Click on the github link below and download the zip file from the repository. Once downloaded you can extract it and run it from the command line by doing "npm install" "node ./src/index.js"

## Usage
This project mainly uses Node.js and sql. I have used a schema.sql to create the tables and the initial contents of said tables. From there the real meat of the project is located on the index.js. There I am using the inquirer and pool pg query to interact with the tables.
